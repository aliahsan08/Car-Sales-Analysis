# Car Sales Data Analysis

## Overview

This project presents a detailed analysis of car sales data across multiple U.S. cities using Python. It includes a Jupyter Notebook that explores patterns, trends, and relationships within a real-world car sales dataset. The primary focus is on understanding regional pricing differences, customer income trends, and sales activity over time.

## Dataset

The dataset includes individual car sale records with the following attributes:

* Dealer and customer information
* Sale price of the vehicle
* Date of sale
* Customer annual income
* Dealer region or city

The data was cleaned to handle missing values, correct data types, and extract useful features such as year and month from the sale date.

## Objectives

The main goals of this project are:

* Analyze average vehicle prices by region
* Explore the relationship between annual income and car price
* Visualize monthly trends in sales activity
* Identify pricing and sales performance differences between regions

## Features

* Data cleaning and preparation
* Aggregation and grouping by region and time
* Correlation analysis
* Visualization using matplotlib and seaborn (bar charts, line plots, regression plots)
* Interpretation of insights from visual trends

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

* **pandas**
* **numpy**
* **matplotlib**
* **seaborn**
* **jupyter**

To install them manually:

**pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter**

## Usage
